# Workspace Ergonomics Analyzer
This project analyzes workspace ergonomics based on an uploaded image and provides suggestions for improvement. The tool identifies key objects, evaluates posture, and measures the user’s distance from the screen to offer insights for a healthier workspace setup.

# Key Features :
Object Identification: Detects specific objects in the workspace such as screens, laptops, keyboard, and mouse, and displays the count of each.<br>
Back Support Analysis: Determines whether the upper, mid, and lower back are supported by the chair, providing "Supported" or "Not Supported" feedback for each section.<br>
Distance from Screen Analysis: Measures the distance between the user and the screen, classifying it as "Less than one arm’s length," "One arm’s length," or "More than one arm’s length."<br>
